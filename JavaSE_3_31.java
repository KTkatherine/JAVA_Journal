 Programming languages:

Some are best at coding =applications that run natively on mobile devices — think Objective-C or Java.

Others are good at encoding logic within a PDF file, or on a web page — think JavaScript.

And still others are best at coding fast applications for virtual machines or running directly on
the operating system — for many people, that’s C or C++.

Want a general purpose language? Think Python, PHP.

R and Matlab are good for statistics and data analytics. And so-on.
