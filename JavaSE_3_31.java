 Programming languages:

Some are best at coding =applications that run natively on mobile devices — think Objective-C or Java.

Others are good at encoding logic within a PDF file, or on a web page — think JavaScript.

And still others are best at coding fast applications for virtual machines or running directly on
the operating system — for many people, that’s C or C++.

Want a general purpose language? Think Python, PHP.

R and Matlab are good for statistics and data analytics. And so-on.

JRE(Java Runtime Environment) is the Java runtime environment. For users of Java programs, not developers.
    If you only download and install the JRE, your system can only run Java programs.
    The JRE is a collection of environments necessary to run Java programs, including the JVM standard implementation
    and the Java core class libraries. It includes the Java Virtual Machine, Java platform core classes,
    and supporting files. It does not contain development tools (compilers, debuggers, etc.).



JDK(Java Development Kit), also known as J2SDK(Java2 Software Development Kit), is a Java development kit,
    which provides the Java development environment (provides the compiler javac and other tools,
    Used to compile java files into class files)
    and the running environment (provided with the JVM and Runtime helper package to parse class files for running).
    If you download and install the JDK, you can not only develop Java programs,
    but also have a platform to run Java programs on. The JDK is the core of Java,
    including the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), a collection of Java tools: tools.jar,
    and the Java standard class library (rt.jar).
