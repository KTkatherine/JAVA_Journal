3_31: Starting with Java: Set learning target, JRE & JDK, "Hello World".

4_01: Data types and operators：The difference of java and javac, Data type (byte, short, int, long, float, char, Boolean and String), ESC, String concatenation         and naming variables.

4_03： Operators, program structures and methods：Interchange between int and char, int and String. atithmetic operators, incremental assignment, relational and          logical operators, bitwise & | ~ ^, shift and conditional operation. Set a code to find ordinary leap year and century leap year, if, switch, while loop,        for loop, system output and input.

04_06: Method overloading and recursion: method, overload and override

04_07:  Recursion: two procedure
        Recursive: The function keeps calling itself until it reaches the function's termination condition, the end of the first phase
        Return procedure: The process by which a function keeps returning. e.g. Enter any positive integer and find the corresponding Fibonacci number, Outputs           each digit of a positive integer in order, Pass in a positive integer and print each digit in reverse order
  
04_08: Array:   
       The relationship between arrays and methods
        1. Arrays as method arguments
       Create a method that takes an arbitrary array of integers and prints them public static void printArr(int[] num) {}
        2. Understanding of reference data types
        Stack - First in First OUT LIFO structure, local variables and parameters of methods are stored on the stack. When the method call ends the stack, the           temporary variable is destroyed    
        
04_10: Array2.0: Copy of arrays, Transfer array to string by implement my method that mimics JDK,  Given an array of integers, find the maximum value of these          number.
